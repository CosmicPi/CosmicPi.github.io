  content: "Interesting concept. I am currently in the High School Teacher program
    at CERN preparing a presentation for my working group. We are addressing muon
    detection, specifically with a similar detector called muon hunter. I have experience
    with the Quarknet version in the US, the DAQ for which is also used in a version
    available in Germany.\r\n     My question for you is this: How will the various
    pixels upload their data for analysis and comparison with the data of other pixels?
    QN has an e-lab with very robust analytical ability for uploaded data, which is
    also accessible to others to do their own analysis. Do you envision something
    similar for Cosmic Pi? If so, how far into the future?\r\n    It would be really
    fantastic if you could reply within 20 hours (by 2000, 21.7.2016) so I can include
    your information in my report. Your vision for a worldwide detector network is
    right along the lines of what I am addressing in my potion of our group's report."

    Hi Darwin! Thanks for getting in touch. Regarding sharing data and analysis our basic model is as follows:
    In the immediate future: Pixel -> Server, where everything lives in a database. We'll make it queriable using REST. We're looking at borrowing from the HiSparc frameworks at the moment as they're open and using Raspberry Pi.
    In the medium term we're involved in Open Cosmics - to share the data, and integrate it with HiSparc and whoever else wants to play. Feel free to get in touch with me though the CERN phonebook tomorrow if you want a chat!

<p>Design reviews are good engineering practice in many industries, so even though this is a volunteer project we've decided that we will do one for Cosmic Pi!&nbsp;We've just published our current main electrical schematic on the open hardware repository for open comment. We'll be holding a physical design review open to anyone interested at CERN on Thursday 7th July from 5pm in Prevessin, however attendance is restricted to those who already have a CERN access card in the course of their professional activities. However, we've also put everything you need to participate virtually on our page at the&nbsp;open hardware repository - so everyone can participate, regardless of where you are in the world.</p>
<div class="image"><a href="/uploads/main-1024x531.png"><img src="/uploads/main-1024x531.png" alt="Our main schematic as of 04/07/16. " /></a><p>Our main schematic as of 04/07/16. </p></div><p><a href="http://www.ohwr.org/documents/487">Here is a link to our current main schematic (drawn in Eagle, currently available in PDF) and the Bill Of Materials (BOM in csv and xls formats).&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>We will be following the approach and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/ed/wiki/Schematics_design_reviews">procedures set out here for the design review</a>. At the moment we're only making the schematic available, once we've been through and addressed the comments we'll probably do the same thing for the PCB layout. If you would like to participate virtually in our design review please head on over to the open hardware repository and check out the schematic, or if you want more information please don't hesitate to get in touch with us directly. For those who wish to participate&nbsp;please try to send us your comments before 12 noon GMT on the 7th July, so we can go over them during the physical meeting.</p>
<p>Based on our Facebook post yesterday, we've already had 2 sets of replies with detailed comments&nbsp;highlighting&nbsp;and explaining fixes for issues we've observed on our prototypes, so we would like to thank those who have participated so far. We will endeavour to keep the list of comments on the main schematic page up to date, to avoid duplication of comments up to the review, after which we'll be releasing an updated schematic.</p>
