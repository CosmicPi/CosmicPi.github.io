<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If you have just received a new Cosmic Pi
unit here are some instructions to get you up and running. If you prefer to
watch rather than read, you can check out our video here:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VVtZo1ndV8"><span
lang=EN-US>Video!</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 1:                             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Remove from packaging</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 2:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Place on a flat, non-metallic, surface</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 3: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Connect the GPS antenna – screw the
connector in carefully. The antenna should be able to see as much sky as
possible, so consider putting it out of a window, on a windowsill, or securing
it to a window. The antenna module is magnetic, so can stick itself to a metal
surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 4:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Connect the power. Plug in the power
adapter to the wall and put the jack carefully into the front of the comic pi
unit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 5:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The power light should come on (sorry, it’s
rather hard to see!) and after a few minutes the event light will start to
flash too. The power light will start to blink once a GPS fix has been
acquired, depending upon the weather and how well your antenna can see the sky
this can take a while – typically it’s 5 minutes, but in poor conditions it can
take much longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 6: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Connect to the Cosmic Pi wifi network,
there is no password. You may need to persuade your device to remain connected
even when there is no internet (since our cosmic ray detector doesn’t provide
its own internet connection) – typically there is a box to tick saying ‘remain
connected even if this connection does not provide access to the internet’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 7:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Open a web-browser and navigate to </span><a
href="http://192.168.0.1"><span lang=EN-US>http://192.168.0.1</span></a><span
lang=EN-US> and it should present you with your cosmic ray data! Sometimes the
graph isn’t up to date as the GPS lock is required to put the correct timestamp
data into the database – so make sure the GPS antenna can see the sky and try
again in 5 minutes. If your computer supports the bonjour protocol, you can
navigate to </span><a href="http://cosmicpi.local"><span lang=EN-US>http://cosmicpi.local</span></a><span
lang=EN-US> as an easier to remember alternative. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Please note that the times on the graph are
UTC, therefore may not be synchronous with the time zone in your location.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Step 8:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You can read all of the sensor data off the
web-page and download the cosmic ray event graphs directly. A full extraction
of the database (i.e. all cosmic ray events from the device) can be extracted
using the advanced, password protected, feature set accessible by the menu on
the left hand side of the web page. If you want to access this please get in
touch with us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Addendum:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We noticed late in production that there is
a small software bug which prevents some units from showing the altitude
(pressure readings are unaffected). If you see that the altitude is showing 0,
this is likely due to the bug. You can always manually calculate your altitude
either via the GPS position or the pressure reading (</span><a
