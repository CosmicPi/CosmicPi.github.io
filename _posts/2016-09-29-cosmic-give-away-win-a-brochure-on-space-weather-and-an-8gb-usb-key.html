<p>We have three brochures from the AFFECTS space weather project to give away, each one includes an 8 GB USB key with videos of space weather and simulations. If you want to enter it's simple - like our <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;cosmicpi">Facebook<&#47;a> page and share our status below! We'll pick a winner at random from all those who have shared on Sunday 2nd October. Good luck!</p>
