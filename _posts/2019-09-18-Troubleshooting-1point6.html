<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Cosmic Pi – Advanced Setup and  Troubleshooting
(V1.6)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What happens if your Cosmic Pi doesn’t work
when you get it out of the box? Here are some common issues we’ve encountered
during testing, if your issue isn’t in the list drop us a line!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Symptom: Nothing happens at all!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>1) Check the power supply</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sometimes the power adapters don’t connect
correctly with the barrel socket on the front of the box. In this case it’s
normally enough to carefully unplug and re-plug it, checking that the power
supply light comes on. You can power the unit with any 7V-12V DC power adapter
if you are concerned about the one that was shipped with the device.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Symptom: No Wi-Fi network appears</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>1) Wait a few minutes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It can take 4-5 minutes for the WiFi
network cosmic pi to be stable when you first power up the device, if it
appears and disappears, it’s probably because your raspberry pi inside the box
has been re-booting (normal on first power on). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>2) If it still doesn’t appear</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Check that you haven’t put your cosmic pi
on top of a metal surface (this interferes with the Wi-Fi propagation – if you
move it to a desk or table and try again the network should be visible).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the Wi-Fi network still doesn’t appear
(it’ll be in the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi range), the SD card has probably been corrupted
(it can happen if the device is power cycled during boot-up). To fix this we’ll
need to re-image the SD card as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Unplug the device from the power and GPS
cables.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Turn the device over and remove the two
recessed screws that hold the top of the case shell in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>With the device the right way up, remove
the top case shell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Carefully remove the microSD card from the
Raspberry Pi Zero W which is secured to the floor of the bottom case shell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Insert the microSD card into an adapter for
a full size card (if required).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Download the Cosmic Pi V1.6 image from
here:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><a

         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once the image is downloaded and unzipped,
follow the instructions here to copy it to the SD card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Replace the microSD card in the Raspberry
Pi and close up the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Connect the GPS and power cables, it should
boot and create the cosmic pi Wi-Fi hot spot as normal. Note that on the first
boot, the device will re-start itself as the SD card partitions are sized to
fill the full card, which may cause the network to disappear and then
re-appear. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hopefully it’s now going to detect some
cosmic rays! If you are unsure about the performance of your device, you can
also look at the test logs we recorded before shipping here:</span></p>
