    Hi Frederic,

    Unfortunately the main barrier to individual assembly at the moment is availability of SiPM sensors, since the minimum order from Advansid who we used in the current design is 100 EUR. As for the scintillators, I'm not sure what the minimum order is from our supplier (Southern Scientific in the UK) but if you ask your nearest univeristy physics department you might be able to get old ones for free!

<p>We've just finished the first draft of a hardware manual. It goes through each of the many circuits that are inside the Cosmic Pi box and attempts to give a rough explanation of the functionality, design principles and other useful information if you are trying to understand or build your own unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We'll be updating it in the future - it's missing the LTSpice schematics as we need to extract them with a Windows machine, amongst other things. Comments, corrections and questions about the content of the document are most welcome!</p>
