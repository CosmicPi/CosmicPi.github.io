<p><b>Ruslan Asfandiyarov (RU)<&#47;b> is a researcher at University of Geneva with wide experience in particle physics. He contributed to the discovery of the Higgs Boson when he worked in ATLAS Collaboration at CERN. And he constructed a detector for a muon accelerator project during his PhD. He is now working on a cosmic ray detector to be launched into space to look for dark matter.</p>
<p><b>Cosimo Cantini (IT) <&#47;b>is an Electronic Engineer currently working at ETH. He works for a Dark Matter experiment (ArDM) and WA105 a new CERN experiment for Neutrino Physics. He is keen on particle detection techniques and generally technology. He loves sport, nature and music.</p>
<p><b>Hugo Day (UK)<&#47;b> is a applied physicist at CERN, working on fast pulsed electromagnets. He enjoys hanging from&#47;on top of rocks, finding ways to make people think differently (or indeed at all) about science and technology, playing games and bodging things together.</p>
<p><b>James Devine (UK)<&#47;b> is an Electrical Engineer working at CERN. He likes to make cool things and has experience in launching balloons to the edge of space and building robotic arms based on Arduino. He has professional experience designing electrical systems for scientific experiments, data centres, schools and laboratories. In his spare time he likes to cycle, ski, programme and prototype software and hardware in Processing and Python.</p>
<p><b>Le&iuml;la Haegel (FR)<&#47;b> is a PhD student in neutrino physics at the University of Geneva. She settled near CERN after studying and getting research experience in material, particle accelerator and black hole physics between France, Ireland and Spain. The Cosmic Pi &nbsp;is her new challenge after learning diving and enjoying her first flight.</p>
<p><b>Etam Noah (UK)<&#47;b> is a researcher at the University of Geneva working on neutrino detectors. He has a general interest in anything to do with particles interacting with matter. He worked on the design and commissioning of the CMS tracker. He is keen to bring bits of giant detectors to a wider audience, especially detector prototypes with educational value. When possible, he plays volleyball, surely the coolest sport on grass, sand or indoors.</p>
<p><b>Justin Salmon (UK)<&#47;b> is a computer scientist currently at CERN. He has previously worked there on massive distributed storage systems for LHC physics experiments, and now works as a Fellow developing high-availability monitoring applications for technical infrastructure. He loves hacking in Python and is an open source enthusiast.</p>
<p><b>Julian Lewis&nbsp;(UK)<&#47;b> is a retired staff member from&nbsp;CERN. He has previously worked on the beam timing system for the Proton Synchrotron and distributed control systems. He loves hiking and has a cat who occasionally assists with lab work.</p>
